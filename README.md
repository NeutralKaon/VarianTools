# VarianTools
A set of utilities for medical imaging, particularly on the Varian (later Agilent) MR platform. 

This repo will be broadly formed into reconstruction and sequence-design tools. Proper documentation will follow. 

If you've used any of these in your research, please cite a relevant paper (or just let me know).
