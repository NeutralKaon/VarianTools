Tools associated with reading, writing and reconstructing MR data from Varian/Agilent scanners 
Utils contains several helpful wrappers surrounding common MR techniques such as n-dimensional centric ordered FFTs (fftc, ifftc, fft2c, ifft2c and fftnc and ifftnc)
Contains code freely reproduced from two other locations; the ISMRM Sunrise Parallel imaging session () and the projection onto convex sets (POCS) method for partial Fourier reconstruction 

Note that the reconVarian function is moderately high level but contains several good ``starting places'' for common sequences 
The procpar reading function returns a struct of parameter name/values 

All vendor-specific functions are Varian orientated, aside from the function readBrukerFid, which reads raw Bruker time domain data
