Xrecon - External Reconstruction
================================


Installation Instructions
=========================

The routines provided here link against the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) and
the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) library of subroutines.
As such these libraries must be installed.

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
--------------------------------
The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is not typically bundled with Linux.
The Xrecon Makefile assumes that the library is installed in either a
standard system location or /usr/local. The library source can be downloaded
from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl. Those subjected to Windoze can install
Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com which includes GSL.

The Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW)
------------------------------------------------
The Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) is not typically bundled with
Linux. The Xrecon Makefile assumes that the library is installed in either a
standard system location or /usr/local. The library source can be downloaded
from http://www.fftw.org/ or copied from /vnmr/imaging/src.

Xrecon
------
Xrecon can be built by typing,

  make

or, for debug mode,

  make debug

Xrecon can be installed using the command,

  make install

or, for Windoze,

  make winstall

The default installation directory is ~/bin which is created if it does not
exist.

Configurations on which Xrecon is known to compile cleanly include:
x86_64 RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 with gcc 4.1.2
i686 Cygwin with gcc 4.3.4
